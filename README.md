# Semantic Satiation

## Description

This is one of those ideas you come up with and decide to implement just for fun.

Thinking about how the words can lose their meaining just by repeating them, I came up with the possibility of building a simple site that let the user play a word or a sentence infinitely by using the [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis).
